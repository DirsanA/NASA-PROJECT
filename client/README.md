ðŸš€ NASA Mission Control ðŸŒŒ

An interactive web application to schedule interstellar missions to Kepler exoplanets! This project simulates NASA's mission planning interface, offering a seamless frontend and powerful backend for scheduling space exploration missions.

ðŸŒŸ Features:

Exoplanet Filtering: Schedule missions to planets meeting specific criteria:
Size: Planetary radius under 1.6 times Earth's.
Stellar Flux: Between 0.36 and 1.11 times Earth's value.
Mission Customization:
Specify a launch date.
Assign a unique mission name.
Choose from available rocket types.
Select a destination exoplanet.
Dynamic User Interface: A visually stunning interface with real-time interaction.
Robust Backend:
Node.js powers the server.
MongoDB stores mission data and planet information.
Future-Proof: Built with scalability and modularity in mind.

ðŸ’» Tech Stack:

Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js with Express.js
Database: MongoDB for efficient and scalable data storage

ðŸš€ How It Works:

Enter mission details, including the name, launch date, rocket type, and destination exoplanet.
The system validates the destination planet against predefined scientific criteria.
Confirm and launch your mission with a single click.
Explore scheduled and historical missions via intuitive tabs.

ðŸ”­ Purpose:

This project is a tribute to humanity's curiosity and space exploration dreams. It provides a platform for space enthusiasts, students, and developers to learn about space missions and develop full-stack skills
